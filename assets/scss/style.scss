IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
